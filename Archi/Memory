Memory Architecture
 - Physcial memory
 - Virtual memory (process can't directly access physical memory, the use their own representaion of memory called virtual memory)
                  (Virtual memory pages are mapped to physical memory)
 - pages
 - Swapping
    .swap out
      . Time (after the rention expires)
      . Demand (Memory pressure)
      . Page fault
      . Swap in
. Excessing Swapping
. Swappiness - 

What to look for?

High consumers of space
  - Physical
  - Virtual
Excessive swapping
  - Swapping in/out
File system cache (OS will allocate left over physical memory to cache frequently accessed files)
