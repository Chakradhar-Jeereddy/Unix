## AWK
```
ðŸ”¹ What is awk?

awk is a powerful text-processing tool in Linux/Unix.

Itâ€™s used for:

Pattern scanning

Text manipulation

Reports & data extraction

Works line by line, splits lines into fields (columns), and allows conditional processing.

ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax
awk 'pattern { action }' filename


pattern â†’ Optional; specifies which lines to process.

action â†’ What to do on matching lines (like print, calculate, etc.).

filename â†’ The file to read.

ðŸ”¹ Common Features

Field-based processing

$1, $2, â€¦ â†’ first, second, â€¦ field of a line (fields separated by whitespace by default)

awk '{ print $1 }' file.txt


Prints the first column of every line.

Pattern matching

awk '/error/ { print $0 }' logfile.txt


Prints all lines containing error.

Field separator

awk -F, '{ print $2 }' file.csv


-F, tells awk that fields are comma-separated, useful for CSV files.

Built-in variables

NR â†’ current line number

NF â†’ number of fields in current line

awk '{ print NR, NF, $0 }' file.txt


Prints line number, number of fields, and the whole line.

Arithmetic & string operations

awk '{ sum += $3 } END { print sum }' file.txt


Sums the 3rd column across all lines.

Example

Suppose data.txt contains:

Alice 100
Bob 200
Charlie 150

```
awk '{ print $1 " scored " $2 }' data.txt
