#Formatted string
#It embed expressions inside string literals, using {} braces.
#It allows to include variables, expressions, or function calls directly in a string, making formatting easier and more readable.

#In python 3.6, f-string are prefixed with an f or F before the opening quotation mark of the string.
#They evaluate the expressions inside {} at runtime and can include expressions of any type.

```
name = 'Krishna'
age = 30
height = 1.6

print("My name is : ,name, I am""+str(age)+" "years old")
print(f"My name is {name}. I am {age} years old. My height is {height} meters") 
--easy to read and write no need of using conversion functions
-- What ever we enter in curly brasses can be expression or variable.
print(f"Kirshana's father is {age*2) years old")

#Exercise
#How many days, weeks, months left if you live until 90 years.
#Input you current age
#Print = you have a days, b weeks and c months left
#365,  52, 12
age = int(input("Enter you age :"))
age_left = 90-age
a = age_left*365
b = age_left*52
c = age_left*12

print(f"You have {a} days,{b} weeks and {c} months left")
